# MachineLearning
We are trying to determine a Classification Model to determine the income of people based on several features.
After doing a few statistical analyses followed by some preprocessing we test 5 different Classifiers:
KNeighbors,MLP,RandomForest,DecisionTree and SVC.

We choose the classifiers that give us the best scores and we seek the best models with a grid search.
